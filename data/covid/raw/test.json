TBLB is needed to rule out lung cancer. Don't worry, she will be alright. First diagnose her and then start appropriate treatment. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further.

By your history and description, possibility of severe pneumonia with sepsis and MODS (multiple organ dysfunction syndrome) is more likely.Best treatment of pneumonia is identification of causative organism and then start appropriate treatment. So get done bronchoscopy and BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) culture and sensitivity report.Also get done blood culture and sensitivity report. Culture report will isolate the causative organism and sensitivity report will guide about effective antibiotic treatment. By this we can achieve faster recovery. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.",

I just completed 5 days of treatment with pills after 4 or more days of IV in the hospital following gall bladder surgery. I entered the hospital with pneumonia (not knowing I had it), probably having contracted it from my brother who had it and whom I had visited several days earlier in another hospital. I am 71 years old, female; I had a non-heart damaging heart attack in 2003 and have tried to maintain a good exercise program to lessen my chances of worsening heart disease. Should I resume Naproxen for joint/muscle pain; had 2 doses (2 tablets twice daily) 2 days before hospitalization. Did not need it the 3rd day and was hospitalized the next day. Did not take it post hospitalization. Do not remember if they gave it in hospital; think not. Thank you.",

You have been adequately treated for your pneumonia and I suppose you don't have any symptoms of pneumonia like cough, fast breathing, fever, breathlessness. Since you have received intravenous plus 5 days of oral antibiotics, now you can resume about your exercise regime. As you say you had a non damaging heart attack, means that your heart pumping function is well preserved. So you must not have any issues with exercise. With every lung infection the lung capacity decreases by some percentage proportional to he severity of the infection. Hence along with your routine exercises you must also undergo breathing exercises with incentive spirometry, inhaling deeply through one nose holding your breath and exhaling fully from the other nose, meditation and yoga. This will help you to regain some of the lost lung capacity. You should also get vaccinated with influenza and pneumonia vaccines that include common strains which cause pneumonia Remember they don't protect you against all pneumonias but offer protection against common pneumonias.Regarding Naproxen too much of it may cause damage to your kidneys so I advice you decrease its usage and use it only when required rather than a daily basis.Wishing you good health.

For diagnosis of pneumonia, chest x ray need to have infiltration.With normal chest x ray, pneumonia is not possible. Cough, congestion, crackles on auscultation are also seen with bronchitis. And bronchitis shows normal chest x ray too.So it is quite possible that you improve within antibiotic because antibiotics also work in bronchitis. So I don't think you are having pneumonia because your chest x ray is normal. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.",
