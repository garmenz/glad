I have had no fever, cold etc Yesterday I felt very lightheaded and also after an episode of diarrea this morning am lightheaded again... I have no trouble breathing as such but I suffer from anxiety which I think has been happening alot today. I have had some twinge type pains in my lower chest ( like at the bottom of ribs) for a few days but not necessarily when I breath in and out and when I do cough I have had mucus? Come up, it s almost like it s stuck in my throat also.... I have some head pressure and am getting cold feet every now and then everything I ve checked says pneumonia does this sound like what I could have or could it just be anxiety, I m a little worried...the symptoms separately come and go but my head stays feeling.a little heavy!
