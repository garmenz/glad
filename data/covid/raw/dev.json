Since you are taking warfarin (blood thinner), possibility of pulmonary embolism (PE) related pain is less likely.Possibility of musculoskeletal pain is more likely. So avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. Avoid movements causing pain. Apply warm water pad on affected areas of chest and back. Take painkiller and muscle relaxant drugs like ibuprofen and thiocolchicoside. You will mostly improve with all these in 2-3 days. If not improving then consult doctor. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.",

So bacterial colonization is common in bronchiectesis. And this gives repeated pneumonia attacks. So best and permanent cure for this is surgical removal of bronchiectic part of lung. So consult Cardio thoracic surgeon and discuss about surgical removal. Another option is culture and sensitivity based treatment. Get done sputum culture and sensitivity report. Culture will identify the causative organism and sensitivity report will guide about effective antibiotic treatment. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your friend. Thanks.",

Possibility of pneumonia is very less because you are not having chest pain, mucus expectoration and your fever is also gone.So drink plenty of fluids orally and keep yourself hydrated. Avoid oily and spicy food. Avoid junk food. Avoid hard to chew food. Take levocetrizine and paracetamol combination twice daily. Do warm water gargles and steam inhalation 4-5 times a day. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.",
